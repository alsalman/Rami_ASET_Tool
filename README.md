Rami_ASET_Tool
==============
Android Sketching and Editing Tool (ASET) is an open source tool that
allows volunteers to sketch objects (e.g., roads and streets) in an
intuitive manner by means of gesture recognition libraries for Android
smart-phones and tablets. Additionally, Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG)
and OpenGL libraries are applied to allow for simple and smooth drawing.
ASET is implemented in Java and runs on Android-based smart phones and
tablets. ASET supports three kinds of gestures; selection, multi-touch
zooming, and multi-touch rotation. A user can select any drawn object by
pressing it. With two or three finger gestures on the Minimum Bounding
Box (MBB)  objects can be rotated and zoomed.
